<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><head>Biography</head><p>Duane Norman Diedrich was born on January 3, 1935, to parents E. L. "Bud" and Blandina Diedrich, in Bloomington, Illinois.  His father had a lengthy career as manager and superintendent for the S. S. Kresge Corporation (later the Kmart Corporation) and his mother worked as a German translator and secretary for State Farm Insurance.  The family lived in multiple places in the Midwest, including Kalamazoo, Michigan (where D. N. Diedrich graduated from high school), and Peru, Anderson, and Muncie, Indiana.</p>

<p>"D. N. Diedrich graduated from the University of Michigan (A.B., 1956; M.A., 1957; Ph.D., 1961), and taught at U-M before leaving to pursue a career in academic teaching and administration elsewhere in the Midwest.  Drawing upon an interest in history instilled in him by his parents and inspired by a personal letter from General Douglas MacArthur in 1952, Dr. Diedrich began to collect original manuscript letters, documents, speeches, musical manuscripts, and other primary sources pertinent to American history.  His first purchase was an original signature of Theodore Roosevelt on a heavy-stock White House card." (Cheney J. Schopieray, <title render="italic">One Hundred Selections from the Duane Norman Diedrich Collection of Manuscript Americana, 17th-20th Century</title>. Ann Arbor, Mich.: William L. Clements Library, 2018: vii-viii).</p>

<p>"As a Professor of Speech, Dr. Diedrich incorporated historical manuscripts into his pedagogy.  He brought authenticity and authority to his classroom instruction by showing students original speech drafts, podium notes, and varying printed versions of speeches.  These materials added relevance, introduced and emphasized concepts, provided illustrations of speechwriting processes, and improved student engagement." (Schopieray, <emph render="italic">One Hundred</emph> ...: xii).</p>

<p>"Dr. Diedrich joined the Clements Library Associates during his graduate student days, in 1958, and served on the organization's Board of Governors beginning in 1975.  On July 8, 1977, he made an agreement with the William L. Clements Library to build a collection of showpieces and research-rich manuscripts, by giving and adding items to his collection, and contributing funding and expertise.  The collection was to include "original, authentic, and historical holograph manuscripts in the categories of religion, education, government, literature, art, music, business, science, and philanthropy."  Working collaboratively with the Library, the Diedrich collection would complement existing holdings, add nuance to certain research areas, and help expand the Manuscripts Division's focus, especially to intellectual, artistic, and social history." (Schopieray, <emph render="italic">One Hundred</emph>...: viii).</p>

<p>Duane Norman Diedrich died at his home in Muncie, Indiana, on October 25, 2018, and is interred with his parents in Elm Ridge Mausoleum, Muncie.</p>

"Vicissitudes are so great and changes so frequent that the continuance of an office when once bestowed is so frail and uncertain that the incumbent lives in constant fear of being turned out, He loses his native independence and becomes a fawning sycophant ever ready to kiss the foot of him who is in power...

Comments on punishments doled out for the students participating in and observing a banned celebration, the "Euclid burial." The severity of punishments stems from students pelting a "very unpopular" sophomore tutor, [Edward Whiting] Gilman (1823-1900), with snowballs, chasing him, and accosting him. Students continued to harass the tutor by obstructing his reading of prayers at church. Guns saluted the election of Taylor to the Presidency. "...I am willing to trust Genl. Taylor on every point save one, and that is the Wilmot Proviso." Distrusts Taylor's position on slavery on account of his southern ties and own personal investment in slavery, believing he has an interest in transplanting slavery to "a new and more productive soil."
