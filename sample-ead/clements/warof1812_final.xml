         <p>The War of 1812 was a military conflict between the United States and Great Britain that lasted from 1812 to 1815.  Fighting occurred primarily along the border between the United States and Canada, along the Eastern Seaboard, and throughout the South.  The British and American navies fought on the Great Lakes and  on the Atlantic Ocean.  The Treaty of Ghent ended the war in December 1814, and the British victory at Fort Bowyer on February 12, 1815, marked the end of the fighting.</p>

Recent snowfall enables them to retrieve "guns and heavy articles" from Rhinebeck.  Still awaiting orders from Commodore [Isaac] Chauncey (1772-1840), "about cordage to be made at Albany."  "My wish- anxiety- desire- to see you is greater than I can tell you."  Made the acquaintance of a Frenchman, De Launay, "a near connexion of the Gentleman of that name who was governor of the Bastile."  Notes De Launay's dislike of the Bonaparte government and his emigration to America to escape it.  "Buonaparte according to his opinion, draws near the close of his tyrannical career, and Europe to the end of her miseries."  Will try to get more evidence concerning his title to his grandfather's property in Scotland.</abstract>
